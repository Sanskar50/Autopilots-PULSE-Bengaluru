    "description": "Brand new iPhone got mugged in crowded Bus on July 15th 2025 500A bus at Eco space Bus stand. OP would have lost more by spending on fuel if he was driving around in a 7 seater 20 lakh + worth SUV alone, in outer ring road, in Bangalore traffic and blocking that much road space for himself. At least he is that much wise considering not to waste the resources for himself and nation. So which is a pound and which is a penny is questionable...\n\nAlso, owning an iPhone is not such a thing as it was a decade ago. A guy riding a KTM(iykyk) also flashes an iPhone bought on EMI or whatever other ways/s...",

    "description": "Brand new iPhone got mugged in crowded Bus on July 15th 2025 500A bus at Eco space Bus stand. First of all, this idea that you will get robbed constantly on the bus is bullshit. There is no statistic to back it up. 47 lakh people use bus daily, theft problem is greatly exaggerated online by those who want an excuse not to use public transport. \n\nI have used bus multiple times a day for years now and despite being dressed in formal office attire i have never ever had any issues. In fact the opposite, on a crowded bus my hand has gone through three different hands to reach the upi qr code. \n\nI'd rather risk the miniscule chance of being pickpocketed on the bus than the much, much larger chance of dying in a road accident on a two-wheeler. \n\nI also know that 12,000 people a year die prematurely in bangalore due to air pollution. I'm happy to not contribute to that if and when I can.",
